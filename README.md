# Hubspot Synchronization

This project involves setting up synchronization between two HubSpot accounts using their APIs. The goal is to establish a secure connection, sync data such as deals and contacts between the accounts, map data fields appropriately, automate the synchronization process, handle errors, and ensure data consistency. The project is implemented using JavaScript and Node.js.




## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to synchronize data between two HubSpot accounts. It involves creating separate HubSpot accounts, setting up private apps on both accounts to access the APIs, establishing a secure connection using the Private App Access Token, and implementing data synchronization between the two platforms.
## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Create two HubSpot accounts, either by signing up for free developer accounts or using existing accounts. Create a private app in each of the HubSpot accounts. These apps will be used to access the HubSpot APIs.

2. Establish a secure connection between the two HubSpot accounts using the Private App Access Token. Configure the app settings, grant necessary permissions, and generate access tokens.

3. Implement the data synchronization process by identifying the relevant APIs and endpoints for syncing deals and contacts data between the two HubSpot accounts. Develop code or use integration tools to pull data from one account and push it to the other account.

4. Map the data fields from one HubSpot account to the corresponding data properties/fields in the other account. This mapping ensures that the correct data is synced to the right fields in both platforms.

5. Set up a schedule for automatic data synchronization between the two HubSpot accounts. Determine the frequency of sync intervals based on your requirements.

6. Implement a data consolidation process to ensure that only the latest, unique, and accurate data is stored in both HubSpot accounts. Develop mechanisms to handle duplicates, resolve conflicts, and update existing records.

7. Implement an error handling mechanism to handle any errors that may occur during the sync process. This includes logging errors, alerting the appropriate parties, and implementing retry mechanisms for failed sync attempts.


## Configuration
Ensure that you have the following configurations set up:

* HubSpot account credentials for both source and* destination accounts.
* Private App Access Tokens for both source and destination accounts.
* API endpoints for dealing with deals and contacts data.
## Data Synchronization
The data synchronization process involves pulling data from the source HubSpot account and pushing it to the destination HubSpot account. Identify the relevant APIs and endpoints for dealing with deals and contacts data. Develop code or use integration tools to automate the data synchronization process.
## Mapping Data Fields
Map the data fields from the source HubSpot account to the corresponding data properties/fields in the destination HubSpot account. This mapping ensures that the data is correctly synced to the appropriate fields in both platforms.
## Sync Schedule
Set up a schedule for automatic data synchronization between the two HubSpot accounts. Determine the frequency of sync intervals based on your requirements. This schedule ensures that the data is regularly synced and up to date.
## Data Consolidation
Implement a data consolidation process to ensure that only the latest, unique, and accurate data is stored in both HubSpot accounts. Develop mechanisms to handle duplicates, resolve conflicts, and update existing records. This ensures data consistency across both accounts.
## Error Handling
Implement an error handling mechanism to handle any errors that may occur during the sync process. Log errors for debugging purposes, alert the appropriate parties, and implement retry mechanisms for failed sync attempts. Robust error handling ensures the reliability of the synchronization process.
## Data Flow and Middleware
Create a middleware responsible for pulling and pushing data between the HubSpot accounts. This middleware ensures consistent data flow in both directions, handling data transformation and communication between the source and destination accounts.
## Tech Stack
The following technologies are used in this project:

* JavaScript: Programming language used for the project.
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
